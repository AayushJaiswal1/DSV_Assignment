# Data Science and Visualisaton Assignment

# Objective
This repository contains solutions for:

1. **Exploring the Iris dataset**:
   - Performing data analysis, displaying summary statistics, and visualizing features.
2. **Splitting the Iris dataset**:
   - Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets for machine learning tasks.
3. **Fitting a Linear Regression Model**:
   - Predicting salary based on years of experience using a simple linear regression model.

# Files
 **1. `DataSplitting.ipynb`**
- Contains code for splitting the Iris dataset into training and testing sets (80-20 split).
- Displays the number of samples in each split.

**2. `Iris_Dataset_Exploration.ipynb`**
- Code for loading and exploring the Iris dataset:
  - Displays the first five rows.
  - Shows the shape of the dataset.
  - Provides summary statistics for features (mean, standard deviation, min/max values).

 **3. `Linear_Regression.ipynb`**
- Implements the following:
  - Loading a dataset with `YearsExperience` and `Salary`.
  - Fitting a linear regression model to predict `Salary` based on `YearsExperience`.
  - Evaluating the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
  - Interactive salary prediction based on user input for years of experience.

**4. `Salary_Data_New.csv`**
- A dataset containing:
  - `YearsExperience`: Number of years of professional experience.
  - `Salary`: Corresponding annual salary in currency units.

### Additional Notes:
-Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.) to run the Jupyter notebooks.
-For further assistance, check the respective notebooks for code and comments explaining each step.
